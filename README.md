What I learnt from this course

* Key concepts of computer Vision & OpenCV.
* Perform image manipulations such as transformations, cropping, blurring, thresholding, edge detection and cropping.
* Segment images by understanding contours, circle, and line detection. How to approximate contours, do contour filtering and ordering as well as approximations.
* Feature detection (SIFT, SURF, FAST, BRIEF & ORB) for object detection.
* Implement Object Detection for faces, people & cars.
* Extract facial landmarks for face analysis, applying filters and face swaps.
* Implement Machine Learning in Computer Vision for handwritten digit recognition.
* Implement Facial Recognition.
* Implement and understand Motion Analysis & Object Tracking.
* Use basic computational photography techniques for Photo Restoration (eliminate marks, lines, creases, and smudges from old damaged photos).
* Getting started in Deep Learning.
